Hello, welcome to my side project of mine where i try to show the virtual view from some of my campus in Jakarta, where it can show multiple places near the campus or even inside the campus.
So far it has only the function of showing the location of the campus and the stores around 2 km around the campus, but i wanted to make more funtions to it than just these.

The main purpose of this project was to show the virtual view of each facility inside the campus and show the direction of the designated class, so it would be easier for the students to access the facilities they wanted to visit or classrooms they wanted to attend.
But at that time, it was just a project of mine to fulfill my assignment task but now that i think about it, it can potentially be a very useful app, not just as an app for students but can be used for public users as well !.
Because from what i've known when using Google Maps and the Street View function, it would only show the virtual view of the designated place but doesn't really show a specific direction to the place so it would be a bit ambiguous.
